# Cat-a-logging Incidents
This repository documents my work on Lab 6 of Codepath's CYB102 course, which involved using Catalyst to manage and investigate three cybersecurity incidents: phishing, malware, and brute force.

## Overview
The goal of this lab was to simulate real-world incident response by:
- Creating incidents in Catalyst
- Investigating IoCs (Indicators of Compromise)
- Using tools like VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB
- Documenting findings and Lessons Learned
- Classifying each incident appropriately

## Tools Used
- Catalyst (self-hosted on Ubuntu VM)
- VirusTotal
- AbuseIPDB

## Screenshots
#### Here's what Catalyst looks like:

#### Investigating the IP and hash (as you can see, they are malicious or compromised):

## Reflections
This lab gave me a better idea of how useful a platform like Catalyst is when you're dealing with real incidents. Instead of keeping everything in separate docs or spreadsheets, it was nice having one place to track what happened, whoâ€™s doing what, and all the evidence we found. It made things feel a lot more organized, especially when juggling multiple incidents.

Adding artifacts like IPs and hashes, then looking them up and logging notes, actually felt like real-world SOC work. It helped me see how important clear documentation and collaboration are during incident response. I could definitely see how a tool like this would make life easier when things get chaotic.
