# Cat-a-logging Incidents

This repository documents my work on Lab 6 of Codepath's CYB102 course, which involved using Catalyst to manage and investigate three cybersecurity incidents: phishing, malware, and brute force.

## Overview
The goal of this lab was to simulate real-world incident response by:
- Creating incidents in Catalyst
- Investigating IoCs (Indicators of Compromise)
- Using tools like VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB
- Documenting findings and Lessons Learned
- Classifying each incident appropriately

## Incident Summaries
Each incident folder includes:
- A brief summary of the event
- Observables and their analysis
- Screenshots from external tools
- Final classification and Lessons Learned

## Tools Used
- Catalyst (self-hosted on Ubuntu VM)
- VirusTotal
- AbuseIPDB
- Docker & Bash scripting

## Screenshots

## Reflections
This lab helped me understand how structured platforms like Catalyst can improve coordination and documentation during real-world incident response.
